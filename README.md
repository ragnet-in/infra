<p align="center">

</p>

Ragnet is an AI-powered DevRel that automatically resolve developer support queries across community channels like Discord, Slack, GitHub, and Telegram specifically for your open source community.

Most open-source dev-facing startups struggle with scaling support: time zone delays, scattered knowledge, and growing community questions outpacing the team. Companies hire DevRels and Support Engineers to bridge this, but it's expensive and doesn‚Äôt scale well.

Ragnet solves this by ingesting your docs, codebase, GitHub issues, architecture diagrams, and past chat history to build an AI agent that answers dev queries instantly, with full source citations. It learns continuously from new interactions and works 24/7! like a fully trained DevRel who knows everything your team ever shipped, but without the human overhead. It‚Äôs baked right inside where your community is there‚Äôs 0 friction for them to use it.
